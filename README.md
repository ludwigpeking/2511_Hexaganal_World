# An Evolutionary History of the City

Is our city a creation of genuious, or an accumulation of the individual decisions made by our precessors and ourselves?
This project gives you a opportunity to observe how a city grows, responding only to the nature and local interests, without a master plan, depending on the choice of location make by an induvidual, based on their trades/preferences. Your play the sand with your hands, and you get the new natural settings for your own version of city.

It is a compressing of the process of centuries into an augenblick

It's presentation acquired inspiraiton from The AR sandbox by UC Davis W.M Keck Center, and the game Townscaper by Oskar Stålberg.

It's a physical representation of some of the aspects of the texts the author wrote around urban history:

# Quadrangulized Map Generator

A powerful tool for generating procedural quadrangulated (quad-based) maps from hexagonal grids using Lloyd's relaxation algorithm. Originally inspired by the grid system used in Oskar Stålberg's game Townscaper, this generator has been transformed into a complete map creation and export system.

## 🎯 Features

-   **Interactive Parameter Controls**: Customize map generation with intuitive UI
-   **Batch Processing**: Generate maps instantly without watching animation
-   **Save/Load System**: Export and import maps as JSON files
-   **Image Export**: Save visual representations as PNG
-   **Complete Tile Data**: Access vertices, centers, neighbors, and areas
-   **Reproducible Results**: Same seed produces identical maps
-   **Standalone Viewer**: Separate HTML viewer for analyzing saved maps

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open** `index.html` in your web browser
2. **Adjust** parameters (or use defaults)
3. **Click** "Generate Map"
4. **Save** your map as JSON or export as PNG
5. **Use** the data in your projects!

## 🔧 Parameters

| Parameter             | Default | Description                  |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Hex Grid Diameter     | 40      | Size of hexagonal cells      |
| Hex Ring Count        | 10      | Number of rings from center  |

## 📦 Map Data Structure

Generated maps contain complete topology information including vertex neighbor relationships:

```json
{
  "params": { ... },
  "tiles": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "vertices": [{"x": 400, "y": 300, "index": 0}, ...],
      "center": {"x": 407.5, "y": 312.5},
      "neighbors": [1, 2, 5],
      "area": 325.5
    }
  ],
  "vertices": [
    {
      "x": 400,
      "y": 300,
      "index": 0,
      "neighbors": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "adjacentFaces": [0, 1, 2]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Vertex Information

Each vertex includes:

-   **Position** (`x`, `y`): Coordinates in the map
-   **Index**: Unique identifier
-   **Neighbors**: Indices of connected vertices (sharing an edge)
-   **Adjacent Faces**: Indices of tiles this vertex belongs to

## 💡 Use Cases

-   **Game Development**: Procedural map generation for strategy games
-   **Mesh Research**: Study quadrilateral mesh properties
-   **Urban Planning**: Base grids for city layouts
-   **Data Visualization**: Unique grid structures
-   **Generative Art**: Creative quadrangulation patterns

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Algorithm

-   Creates hexagonal grid from center
-   Merges triangles into quads
-   Subdivides mesh for detail
-   Applies Lloyd's relaxation
-   Calculates topology (neighbors, areas)

### Technologies

-   **p5.js** for rendering and UI
-   **JavaScript** for logic
-   **JSON** for data export
-   **Canvas** for visualization
